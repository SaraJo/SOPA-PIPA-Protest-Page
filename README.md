Let's Save the Internet!

This is a standardized page for the internet blackout planned for 1/18/2012. Feel free to contribute to the design, or fork to do something cool. This README will contain a list of sites planned to be taken down for the duration of the day of 1/18/2012. Please add yours, or ping me at sarajchipps@gmail.com and I will add it to the list.

If you are not a developer, or you don't know how to work the GitHubs, and you would like to participate reach out to sarajchipps@gmail.com, and myself or a lovely assistant  will walk you through the process beforehand, and help you revert your site back the way it was  afterwards.
